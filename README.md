# Welcome!

Vertic has been engaged by Make a Wish (MaW) to deliver a Bulk Donation Entry Tool. The purpose of this tool was to create a way for creating consistent batch entry form templates that the MaW team can use to enter gifts into their Salesforce environment, individually or in batches.&#x20;

The tool allows setting default at the batch level, or at the template level. This is a custom tool built by Vertic that has been integrated with the existing data models of Salesforces' NPSP as well as Verticâ€™s custom NPSP+ Stripe Payment Processing Package.
