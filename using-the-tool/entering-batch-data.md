# Entering Batch Data

#### Committing Batch Records

{% hint style="info" %}
Here is a video walk through of how to commit a Donation Entry to a Batch:&#x20;

{% endhint %}

**Note:** When you commit a Donation to a Batch, please note that this **will** create the Opportunity but set the Stage to `Pledged`. When a User with the appropriate permissions has reviewed the Batch, they have the power to hit the `Approve` button which will set the Opportunity Stage to `Closed Won`.

#### Editing Committed Batch Records

If you would like to edit an existing Batch Record, click the Pencil Icon, to bring the Donation information back to an editing area. This saves you from needing to delete and recreate batch entries for people like Johan Ford in this example, should you have input an incorrect `Amount.`
