# Creating or Opening a Batch

There are **2** possible selections you can make when you open the Bulk Entry Tool:

1. Create a New Batch
2. Open an Existing Batch

### Creating a Batch

When creating a **new** batch, we select the radio button next to `Create a New Batch`. A user would then be required to customise (if they wish to) the Batch Name, as well as choosing **which** Bulk Donation Template to use.&#x20;

Please note, it is important to select the correct Bulk Donation Template, as this will inform which fields are automatically available to you when you create a batch.

{% hint style="info" %}
* **Batch Name**
  * There is a default naming convention of the `Bulk Donation - [DD/MM/YYY]` that auto-populates the creation of any new Batch Name.
  * This can be deleted, if a user wishes and the person creating the Batch Donation has the ability to name a Batch whatever they wish.&#x20;
  * Once the Batch has been created, a Batch ID Number will be generated and available on the Entry Page `BCH-00000`.
    * When a Batch is created, it is available for review under the NPSP Batch Object.
* **Bulk Donation Template**
  * See the Donation Template Overview Page Shortcut Below.
* **Expected Total $ & Expected Number of Donations**
  * This is not required, but can be used as a guide when creating new Batch Entries.&#x20;
  * Once a Batch has been opened, a User can compare these values against ACTUAL amounts.

### Open an Existing Batch

When you open an existing Batch, you will **not** be able to select the Bulk Donation Template, as this will reference the existing Batch selection for this Template.&#x20;

You are able to search for a Batch with either:

* Name; OR
* Batch ID (ie. `BCH-00475`)
