#### What are Default Fields?

Organised into collapsible Salesforce Objects via an accordion structure, a User is able to input 'default fields' to be automatically pre-populated when committing donations to a Batch (the screen that you see when you hit `Continue`.&#x20;

#### Use Case

Having default fields reduces the time spent by Users committing data to Batches, by allowing a User to automatically pre-populate certain fields such as `CampaignID,   CloseDate etc`for example.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note:&#x20;

* Each Template used displays its 'own' default fields, therefore make sure to select the appropriate Template for the information you wish to enter.
* The fields that appear on this screen (Template Screen) can only be modified by a User who has been given the appropriate permission set.&#x20;
* Typically, most users will have permissions enabled to edit only their own Batch (after it has been created) - where users can _also_ set default fields, or act to show / hide certain fields.
