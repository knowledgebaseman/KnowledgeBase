# Template Customisation - Global Templates \[ADMIN]

Please see the Permissions Set screen to understand all the permission sets available to admins:

{% content-ref url="../rules-validation-automation-and-permission-sets/permission-sets.md" %}
[permission-sets.md](../rules-validation-automation-and-permission-sets/permission-sets.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

> Admin users whom have been assigned to the `Edit_Bulk_Donation_Template` permission set can see the Settings button even if they donâ€™t select a batch and close the first modal on page load stage + a toggle button is accessible for them in the Settings Modal to select which template they would like to update and see: Batch Level or Template Level: [Demo](https://take.ms/EEV9F).

Please see a [video walk through](https://www.loom.com/share/426230f8ffa54959a2336bb003c90065) of this process explained and how it works.

**Note:** Any changes made on the Template Customisation side of things will apply globally to all new templates created for all new users across the environement. This does not occur however on Batch Level template changes.&#x20;
