{% hint style="info" %}
It is important to select the appropriate Bulk Donation Template with the Donation Entries a User is wishing to input. This is because each template carries with it, its own specific fields.&#x20;

_Example:_

* If you wish to process multiple Credit Card Donations via the Bulk Donation Entry Tool, you would not be advised to use any template **but** the `Credit Card` Template. This is because, specific to this template, the `Credit Card` Template has a Stripe Payment Plugin to process and submit CC donations - whereas other Template do not. The same applies to other fields, and what should appear / not appear as fields on that layout.
